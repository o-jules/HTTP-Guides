## URL shortcuts

### Relative URLs

URL come in two flavors: `absolute` and `relative`.

#### Base URLs

The base URL serves as a point of reference for the relative URL.

#### Resolving relative references

Convert a relative URL into an absolute one to break up both the relative and base URLs into their component pieces.

## Shady characters

URLs are designed to be:

  1. *portable*: URLs are permitted to contain only characters from a relatively small, universally safe alphabet
	2. *readable*: invisible, nonpriting characters also are prohibited in URLs.
  3. *complete*: an esacpe mechanism was added, allowing unsafe characters to be encoded into safe characters for transport.
